In this document we are going to analyze 5 companies stock prices over a 5-year period. 

### What Companies?
Apple (AAPL), Bank of America (BAC), General Electric (GE), Exxon (XOM) and WalMart (WMT).  
 
### Code Organization
In order to maximize re-usability and make the script reproducible I have decided to use  [quantmod](http://www.quantmod.com/) library. This library makes data retrieval process automated with no hard copies needed to be downloaded.

### Load Required Libs
You don't need to install anything manually as the script will do that for you if needed: 
```{r, echo=T}
quantmod.loaded <- require('quantmod')
if(!quantmod.loaded){
  install.packages('quantmod',repos="http://cran.rstudio.com/")
  library(quantmod)
  library(xts)
}
ggplot2.loaded <-  require('ggplot2')
if (!ggplot2.loaded) {
  install.packages('ggplot2',repos="http://cran.rstudio.com/")
  library(ggplot2)
}
```

### Get Stock Data
Now we are ready to load all the stocks data into our app. keep in mind that at anytime, you can add more stock tickers to *stock.names* vector or customize it to your needs:
```{r, echo=T,cache=T}
# Get 5 companies stock data from Yahoo Finance
stock.names <- c('AAPL','BAC','GE','XOM','WMT','NYA','^IXIC')
getSymbols(stock.names,src='yahoo')
stock.dfs <- list(AAPL,BAC,GE,XOM,WMT,NYA,IXIC)
```

###Functions
Let's define two functions to calculate average annual returns and compound 5-year growth rate (return). The latter would be a good indicator of absolute yearly rate of returns. Note that we should not use simple average, arithmetic mean, over multiple time periods.  
```{r, echo=T}
stocks.get.returns <- function(company.names){
  returns.df <- list()
  N <- length(company.names)
  for (name.index in 1:N) {
    returns <- periodReturn(company.names[[name.index]],period='yearly',subset='2010::2015')
    names(returns) <- c(stock.names[name.index])
    returns.df[[name.index]] <- returns
  }
  result <- Reduce(merge,returns.df)
  colnames(result)[6:7] <- c('NYSE','NASDAQ')
  return(result)
}
calculate.compound.return <- function(data.returns){
  compund.averages <- as.data.frame(apply(as.data.frame(data.returns), 2, function(x) x <- (prod(x+1)^(1/length(x)) - 1)*100))
  names(compund.averages) = c('Average')
  return(compund.averages)
}
```
###Calculate Yearly Absolute & Relative Returns
```{r echo=T}
returns.yearly <- stocks.get.returns(stock.dfs)
```

The table above shows that Apple returns dropped more that 80% in 2014. This was due to a split and not performance. We can fix this issue by using the adjusted close values: 
```{r}
stock.dfs.adjusted <- lapply(stock.dfs,function(x) x <- adjustOHLC(x, use.Adjusted=TRUE))
returns.yearly <- stocks.get.returns(stock.dfs.adjusted)
```

Now we are ready to calculate the compound returns. This value gives us a better understanding of overall stocks performance from 2010 to 2015:
```{r}
compounds <- calculate.compound.return(returns.yearly)
```

This table is showing us that Apple has been a high performer and Bank of America has the least absolute return. Looking at the market return rows, NYSE & NASDAQ, we can also compare the returns relative to their corresponding market performance:
```{r}
apple.relative <- cbind(compounds[compounds$Stock=='AAPL',],NASDAQ=compounds[compounds$Stock=='NASDAQ',2],Relative=compounds[compounds$Stock=='AAPL',2]/compounds[compounds$Stock=='NASDAQ',2])
```
![](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8o4hzmb3gzksdb6/Screenshot%202016-02-14%2012.10.32.png?dl=1)

And the other 4 stocks in the NYSE composite.
Note that you get to also observe NASDAQ Vs. NYSE performance:
```{r}
others.relative.performance <- (cbind(compounds[compounds$Stock!='AAPL',],NYSE=compounds[compounds$Stock=='NYSE',2],Relative=compounds[compounds$Stock!='AAPL',2]/compounds[compounds$Stock=='NYSE',2]))
```

###Calculate Volatility
The volatility is a statistical measure of the dispersion of returns. The higher this value the riskier the stock performance.
We need to calculate standard deviation:
```{r}
calculate.risk <- function(returns){
  volat.df <- as.data.frame(apply(returns,2,FUN=sd))
  volat.df <- cbind(row.names(volat.df),volat.df)
  names(volat.df) = c('Stock','Volatility')
  return(volat.df)
}
```

Then we can call this function to calculate risk associate with the annual returns:
```{r}
risks.df <- calculate.risk(returns.yearly)
```

###Analysis
I am not an expert in finance but overall we can say that we would like to have stocks with highest rates of returns but low volatility.  
It seems that Bank of America Stock (BAC) is not a good bet at all as it has the highest risk and the lowest return.  
GE stocks would be a very safe bet as the risk is moderately low while the annual return is the highest compared to NYSE composite/profile.
